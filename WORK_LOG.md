I need to continue coding this method. |
| 1/26 |  10:45-11:55  | I spent this time in class discussing at a high level what kind of dynamic programming algorithm could solve this problem. Eventually, Liam, Stevie and I came up with a solution of going top-down, starting with our target and subtracting coins until we get to either 0 or a negative number (base cases). Importantly, it would use dynamic programming by saving the ('number of ways') to get to each number and incrementing it each time we see that same number again (this is recursive). |

The solution I came up with was that from a given coin in our list, you can only either add that coin or any coin greater than it, but not smaller. This way we deal with every case but do not over count (I think). |
